Hello,
My name is Miroslav Jovic, and I am still learning HTML, CSS and SASS

Keeping this in mind, I made this project by looking video: "Build a Responsive Website | HTML, CSS Grid, Flexbox & More", link on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0bGHP-PXD4&ab_channel=TraversyMedia, channel: Traversy Media

That project from video is done only in HTML and CSS, but I was working with SASS, for practice.

Thanks a lot Brad, Traversy Media :)
